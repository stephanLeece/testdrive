    <p>DriveDrive is a project initiated by visual artists Raissa Angeli and Nayia Savva. It’s located in the old town of Nicosia, in a building designed by the modernist architect Neoptolemos Michaelides in 1969.
DriveDrive displays a selection of artworks, editions and publications in a fluctuating, ever evolving manner. The process is archived in an online index publication.
The space runs parallel to TESTDRIVE, a project hosting short-term site-specific events and parties.
DriveDrive and TESTDRIVE are the result of on going conversations and debates between friends, artists, artist-friends, and artists’ friends concerned with the multiple localities involved in operating on the island.
The project will be open to the public for the year 2018-2019.</p>
